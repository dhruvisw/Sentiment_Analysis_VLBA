# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis System for Movie Reviews
End-to-End NLP • Microservices • Cloud Deployment • Scalable Architecture

This project implements a full production-style sentiment analysis system for movie reviews — built with modern NLP techniques and deployed using a scalable microservices architecture. Designed as part of the VLBA System Architectures module at OVGU, it demonstrates how ML, software engineering, and cloud technologies come together to deliver fast, reliable, low-latency predictions at scale.

🚀 Key Features

- 92% F1-score NLP model using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Microservices architecture (React frontend, Flask API, ML service, Redis worker)
- Asynchronous processing for CSV uploads via Redis Queue
- MongoDB database for persistent review and prediction storage
- Fully containerized using Docker
- Cloud deployment on Google Cloud (Cloud Run + Compute Engine)
- Real-time + batch inference support
- Clean and intuitive React UI for uploading reviews and viewing predictions
